## Social Media API (Blaqee)

The choice of my capstone project was inspired by my desire to contribute to the society where I come from: Kenya, and Africa at large. I often found social media applications biased against the black community and other minorities who are not well represented in Silicon Valley tech development teams. In essence, a development team's core duty is to suit the users' preferences the best they can, but that is limited to the very lens through which they view the user. 

In this spirit, I chose to build a social media application that reflects my lens, and by extension, the people of my ilk. For pun, let’s call this app **Blaqee!**

I intend to make the social media app revolutionary in its operation by providing the user with the ability to access, in one place, clearly organized information related to **jobs**, **finance**, **education**, **comedy**, **science**, **social**, and others. The idea is to have preset tags to select when making a post. There will be no post without a tag. This way, the application will have distinct categories for users to view related posts. The **"others"** tag will allow all users to have a default tag if they don’t understand which category they would like to submit their posts to.

As with traditional social media apps, Blaqee will have features like:
- **Post Reposts**
- **Post Shares**
- **Post Likes**
- **Post Comments**
- **User Mentions**
- **User Follows/Followers**
- **Hashtags**
- **Notifications**
- **Direct Messaging**
- **Trending Posts**
- **Feed Posts** (for following users)
- **User Account Management**
- **User Authentication**
- **View Permissions**
- **Pagination**
- **Filtering** and **Sorting**

The goal is to create a platform where users feel their voice and culture are accurately represented, in contrast to existing social media platforms that often overlook or misrepresent minority voices.
